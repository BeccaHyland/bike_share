### Description
BikeShare provides analytic information on local bike use that empowers commuters to ditch their cars. Users can access weather, past trip, and station data as well as an e-commerce platform to purchase bike accessories. BikeShare aspires to increase the amount of bike traffic while reducing the number of cars on the road.

### Features
* Analysis and display of San Francisco bike share data from seed files
* User authentication supported by the __bcrypt__ gem, which gives the user access to cart checkout, their account information, and analytics dashboards for easy trip planning.
* Admin authorization provides access to create, edit, and remove bike stations, bike store items, and trip or weather records. Admin can access all bike store orders for all users.
